# SQL-Data-Cleaning-
This project contains two SQL scripts, one is specifically for cleaning the data and the other is to explore and find the needed information.
Data cleaning entails deleting duplicates, Stadardizing formats, and updating certain values if they have the wrong input or a blank value.


## Get Started
1) Downloaded the CSV file and create new database in MySQL
2) First create a table by selecting table data import wizard and follow the steps to import the layoffs CSV file
3) create duplicate table as the staging table

## Lessons Learned
The first piece of knowledge gained from this project is it's important to create staging tables. The raw data should remain the same in case a mistake is made when changing the dataset.

CTEs are a more advanced skill in SQL but are much easier to use compared to complex subqueries. With CTEs you have to reference it right after creating it.
